# Company Profile

Brenta is a contemporary marketing agency and creative production studio founded by **Wladimiro Bizzotto**, bringing together strategy, design, and technology to help organisations navigate complexity.

With over 25 years of experience solving marketing challenges across creative industries—entertainment, fashion, publishing, engineering—and the public sector—healthcare, welfare, regional administration—we work at the intersection of cultural sensitivity, intellectual rigour, and operational excellence.

Our practice integrates agile methods, open‑source technologies, behavioural insights, and systemic thinking to build brand ecosystems, craft immersive digital experiences, and develop scalable marketing infrastructures.

We serve startups, institutions, and global brands alike, offering consultancy, project leadership, co‑management, and interim marketing management. Our approach bridges innovation and meaning, aligning tactical execution with deeper narrative frameworks.

At Brenta, we believe marketing must not merely follow trends but critically shape how brands participate in the evolving architectures of attention, trust, and interaction. Our commitment is to design systems that resonate—through beauty, expertise, and authenticity—while remaining aware that every communicative act operates within broader fields of influence and control.

*Brenta pioneers holistic marketing strategies rooted in ethical design, creative technology, and media‑savvy storytelling—helping our clients adapt, engage, and grow in an ever‑changing world.*
